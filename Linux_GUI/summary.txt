 good morning class today will study the data structure erase and let's begin so as we know erase it is a one dimensional Data Structure it is a list of values with the same data type that is stored using single group name and the size of the array has been declared initially a one of the biggest advantage of arrays is that we can get the elements value and index so if we write 83 we can directly get the value let's move on the indexing of Array it starts from 0 and its goes up to and -1 Where n is the number of elements are you can initially as array in multiple ways you are you are examples of which have shown in this slide and then there are two dimensional arrays it is it is like a two-dimensional mat very have to specify the number of rows and columns initially and you can install it like a matrix and it is a very useful data structure
